## Reflection

This project was completed as the final project in my Application Development I course. I ran into some obstacles while completing this project such as determining the organization of the project, however I was able to overcome those challenges. I feel like this project was a major learning experience for me. Not only was I able to build a fun game using an Object-Oriented language, but I was also able to practice and strengthen my knowledge of advanced Object-Oriented principles and best practices.
